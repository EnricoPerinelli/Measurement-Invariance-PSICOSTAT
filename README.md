# Measurement Invariance with Structural Equation Modeling
 
Brief talk for PSICOSTAT group titled "Measurement Invariance with Structural Equation Modeling" (June 17, 2022).

The file `MI_Psicostat.pdf` is the presentation; the files `MI_Ordinal.rmd` and `MI_Ordinal.html` are the RMarkdown file and the knitted HTML file, respectively.
These file are also available [https://psicostat.dpss.psy.unipd.it/files/2022-06-17_perinelli.pdf](here) and [https://psicostat.dpss.psy.unipd.it/files/2022-06-17_perinelli.html](here), respectively.

In `MI_ordinal` files, I reported an application of a Measurement Invariance with Ordinal Variables. Notice that these results were subsequently published in the following open-access journal article:
