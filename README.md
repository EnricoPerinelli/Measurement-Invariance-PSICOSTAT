# Measurement Invariance with Structural Equation Modeling
 
Brief talk for PSICOSTAT group titled "Measurement Invariance with Structural Equation Modeling"

The file `MI_Psicostat.pdf` is the presentation; the files `MI_Ordinal.rmd` and `MI_Ordinal.html` are the RMarkdown file and the knitted HTML file, respectively.
In `MI_ordinal` files I reported an application of a Measurement Invariance with Ordinal Variables.

Notice that results were subsequently published in the following open-access journal article:
